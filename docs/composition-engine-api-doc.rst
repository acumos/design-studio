Design Studio Composition Engine Application Programming Interfaces
====================================================================


API 
====
1.	Create New Composite Solution
--------------------------------------
	**Operation Name**
		createCompositeSolution
	**Trigger**
		This API is called when the user creates a new composite solution by clicking the + sign in the Design Studio.
	**Request**
		{
		   userId:string;//mandatory

		}
	**Response**
		{
		 cid: string //serves as session Id. 
		success : boolean,
		 errorMessage: string // if generated by the Composition Engine

		}

	**Behavior**

		1.	The Composition Engine must check if the request JSON structure is valid, otherwise it should return success as false and a user friendly message, such as “Incorrectly formatted input – Invalid JSON”.

		2.	The Composition Engine must return the success as false if the userId is not provided and should return a user friendly error message such as – “User Id required”.

		3.	The Composition Engine will create a new cdump file, which will be named and versioned later on when the save composite solution API is called. Initially the cdump file will not have any nodes or links populated in it. They will be added with each addNode and addLink operation called by the UI Layer, or modified with deleteNode, deleteLink, modify Node, modifyLink operations, described later.

		4.	The Composition Engine will generate a UUID, which serves as a session Id, and populate the cid field in the cdump file with this UUID.

		5.	The Composition Engine must associate the user Id with the cid. 

		6.	The Composition Engine will populate the ctime field with the current time stamp.

		7.	The solution Id is not available to Composition Engine at this time. It will be available when the solution is stored in the backend catalog. 
		
		8. 	Make the ProbeIndicator in the cdump file as "false".
		
		9.  Mark the validSolution flag in the cdump file as "false".

		10.	At this time the Composition Engine is not storing any data in the Catalog DB nor in the Nexus repository.

		11.	The Composition engine must return the cid and success code to the caller. 


	
2. Save Composite Solution - User clicks Disk Icon on Design Studio
--------------------------------------------------------------------


	**Operation Name**

	saveCompositeSolution

	This operation creates an entry for a new solution and its version or updates an entry for the existing solution version in Catalog DB and commits the solution (cdump file) to the Nexus repository.

	**Trigger**

	This operation is called when the user request the SAVE of the composite solution.

	**Request**

	{

		userId: string,// user logged into Portal – mandatory 

		solutionName: string, //name provided by the user – mandatory – this can be changed at any time on SAVE operation

		solutionVersion: string, //version provided by the user – mandatory – this can be changed at any time on SAVE operation

		solutionId: String, //provided only if an existing solution is being updated, otherwise it will be empty. 

		description: string, //provided by user

		cid: string // composition Id originally generated by backend and returned to UI Layer as a response to createNewCompositeSolution API, now it is provided as input by UI Layer – this field is mandatory if the solution Id is missing. Mandatory for initial save request.

		ignoreLesserVersionConflictFlag: boolean //populated if the user wants to ignore overwriting of lesser version of this solution.

	}

	**Response**

	{

		Success: boolean, //

		errorMessage: string // (for example – when the user attempts to over write a previous 

		cdump file of the composite solution// includes nodes & edges of graph

	}

	**Behavior** 

	1.	The Composition Engine must check if the request JSON structure is valid, otherwise it should return a user friendly message, such as “Incorrectly formatted input – Invalid JSON”. 

	2.	The Composition Engine must ensure that the mandatory parameters have been populated, otherwise it should return a user friendly message, such as “Solution Name missing”, “Solution Version missing”, etc.

	3.	The Composition Engine must ensure that the cid provided in the input is one of the cid’s it had generated earlier, otherwise it should return an error message to the UI Layer – “Unknown Composition Id”. 
	
	4.  Mark the validSolution flag in the cdump file as "false".

	5.	(Future) The Composition Engine must call the Modeling Engine to ensure the TOSCA validation of cdump file. (Future Sprint actions)

	6.	The Composition Engine will:

		a.	CASE – 1: If this is a new solution (cid is provided and solutionId is missing)

			i.	Create a new solution entry in the Catalog DB with the solution name and solution version provided as the input of the API. The Catalog DB will generate and provide the solutionId. The Composition Engine must make sure to set the following values as follows in the backend Catalog DB:

				1.	isComposite is set to TRUE

				2.	toolKitType = “DS”

				3.	visibility level = PRIVATE

			ii.	Correlate the solution Id with the cid provided by the API. 

			iii.	Store the validated cdump JSON file, so far built, in the Nexus – cdump file location. 

			iv.	Update the cdump file location in the solution version table. 

			v.	Populate the solutionId field of the cdump file with the solutionId provided by the Catalog DB. 

			vi.	Populate cname and version fields in cdump file with solution name and version provided in the API input.

			vii.	Populate the mtime field in the cdump file with the current timestamp. 

		b.	CASE – 2: If the solutionId already exists and the solution name and solution version provided (inputted) by the API also already exists (version conflict) in the Catalog, then:

			i.	(Now there exists an updated cdump file in the Composition Engine)

			ii.	Composition Engine must now make an association between cid and solutionId.

			iii.	Populate the mtime field in the cdump file with the current timestamp. 

			iv.	Composition Engine will now replace (and discard) the existing cdump file in Nexus repository with the updated (i.e., in memory) cdump file. 

			v.	Update the existing solution version entry to point to the location of the updated cdump file saved in the Nexus repository.

			vi.	Update the timestamp in the catalog DB. 

		c.	CASE – 3: : If the solutionId and the solution name already exists in the Catalog DB, but the solution version provided by API is different which does not exist in the Catalog DB, then

			i.	(Now there exists an updated cdump file in the Composition Engine)

			ii.	The Composition Engine will create a new version of the Solution in the Catalog DB, against the version number that is provided in the API input.

			iii.	Populate cname and version fields in cdump file with solution name and version provided in the API input. 

			iv.	Populate the mtime field in the cdump file with the current timestamp.

			v.	The Composition Engine will save the in – memory cdump file in the Nexus.

			vi.	The Composition Engine will populate the cdump file location in the new Solution Version table, created in the step above.

			vii.	The Composition Engine will update the timestamp if the Catalog DB.

		d.	CASE – 4: SolutionId, Solution Name and Solution Version already exists in the DB, but the solution version provided by the user is not the latest one (i.e., it is smaller than the most recent version) and the “ignoreLesserVersionConflictFlag” flag is set to False (default value).

			i.	The Composition Engine will do a lookup operation as usual, and if it finds the solution version provided by the user already exists and it is smaller than the most recent version, it must set success flag as false and send error message to the UI Layer – “Do you want to update a previous version of this solution?”

			ii.	The UI Layer will present this message to the user. 

			iii.	If the user accepts, then the UI Layer will send another saveCompositeSolution API call to the Composition Engine, this time with “ignoreLesserVersionConflictFlag” flag set to True.

		e.	CASE – 5: Solution Id, Solution Name and Solution Version already exists in the DB, but the solution version provided by the user is not the latest one (i.e., it is smaller than the most recent version) and the “ignoreLesserVersionConflictFlag” flag is set to True.

			i.	Populate the mtime field in the cdump file with the current timestamp. 

			ii.	Composition Engine will now replace the existing cdump file in Nexus repository with the updated (i.e., in memory) cdump file. 

			iii.	Update the existing solution version entry to point to the location of the updated cdump file saved in the Nexus repository.

	7.	The Composition Engine will populate the following fields in the Catalog DB:

		a.	userId (provided in the request)

		b.	ownerId: Same as userId

		c.	provider: The provider (Organization) should have been already provisioned in the USER TABLE - (check with Chris and Ashwin)

		d.	toolKitType Code: "DS"

		e.	category: (Check with Chris)

		f.	description: provided in the input

		g.	visibilityLevel: "PR"

	4.	If the user is the owner of the solution, then Composition Engine must perform the following functions:

		a.	Delete the cdump file associated with the solution version from the Nexus.

		b.	Delete the Version entry of the solution in the Catalog DB.


5. Add node
------------

	4.  Connects the output port of the Collator to the input port of the next ML Model (output message signature for collator should be added collator_map in cdump file). This is because this link can be added any time even before the collation scheme is selected which is sent via modifyNode.  Collator change
	
	5.  Connects the input port of the Splitter to the output port of the previous ML Model (input message signature for splitter should be added splitter_map in cdump file).

7. Delete Node
---------------


	**Operation Name**

	deleteNode

	**Trigger**

	This operation is requested when the user deletes a node in the composition graph. This node may be connected to other nodes or it may be an isolated (un-connected) one. When a node is deleted all links connected to it (either originate from it or terminate on it) must also be deleted. This operation may result in some existing nodes becoming isolated. 

	**Request**

	{

		userId: string, //mandatory

		solutionId: string // this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution

		version: string// this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution

		cid: string // composition Id originally generated by backend and returned to UI Layer as a response to createNewCompositeSolution API, now it is provided as input by UI Layer –  this field should be populated (mandatory) if the solutionId and version is missing such as  for a new un – saved solution. 

		nodeId: string// mandatory

	}

	**Response**

	{

	 success: boolean,

	 errorMessage: string // error string to be displayed to user.

	}

	**Behavior**

	1.	The Composition Engine must check if the request JSON structure is valid, otherwise it should return success as false and a user friendly message, such as “Incorrectly formatted input – Invalid JSON”. 

	2.	The Composition Engine must ensure that all the fields marked mandatory are populated,  otherwise it must return success as “false” and populate the helpful error message which is displayed to the user, such as “Cannot perform requested operation – Node Id missing”, etc.

	3.	If the requested nodeId is not found in the cdump file, the Composition Engine must return success as false and a user friendly message, such as “Invalid Node Id – not found”.

	4.	The Composition Engine must:

		a.	Delete the specified node entry in the nodes list of the cdump file.

		b.	Find all the links that are connected to the specified node (originate from the node or terminate on the node) and delete these link entries in the relations list of the cdump file.

		c.	(Sprint - 4) For each link that terminates on the specified node, find the corresponding source node of the link. These source node are the ones whose Requirements are now un-fulfilled. These nodes may now need to display a warning message to the Design Studio user. (I think the UI Layer would automatically be able to display the warning message when a Requirement is un-fulfilled. Perhaps there is no need for the composition engine to send a warning message to be displayed on the affected nodes).

	5.	Return success as True to the client.

	6.	(NOTE: In future, composition engine may have rules to reject deletions)


8. Delete Link
---------------

		e.	If no matches are found, then return success as false, and populate the errorMessage as “No matching models found”, otherwise return success as True. 

	4.	Return the response to the UI Layer. 


21. Validate Composite Solution
--------------------------------

	**Operation Name**

	validateCompositeSolution 

	**Trigger**

	This operation is called by the UI Layer when the user clicks on the Validate Button in the Design Studio. 

	When the response to this API is received, the UI Layer, should populate the Validation Console with either a single success message or a list of error and warning messages returned by the backend Composition Engine. 

	**Request**

	{

		userId: string, //mandatory

		solutionId: string // this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution

		version: string// this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution

		cid: string // composition Id originally generated by backend and returned to UI Layer as a response to createNewCompositeSolution API, now it is provided as input by UI Layer –  this field should be populated (mandatory) if the solutionId and version is missing such as  for a new un – saved solution. 

	}

	**Response**

	{

		success: boolean,

		validationMessages[]: string // A single “Validation Successful” message or a list of one or more Error messages and Warning Messages.

		errorMessage: string // error string to be displayed to user.

	}

	**Behavior**

	1.	The Composition Engine must check if the request JSON structure is valid, otherwise it should return success as false and a user friendly message, such as “Incorrectly formatted input – Invalid JSON”. 

	2.	The Composition Engine must ensure that all the fields marked mandatory are populated,  otherwise it must return success as “false” and populate the helpful error message which is displayed to the user, such as “Cannot perform requested operation – User Id missing”, etc.

	3.	The Composition Engine must perform hte following validations:
	
		a.	A composite solution can only have nodes of the following types.
			
			i.	MLModel
			
			ii.	Splitter
			
			iii. Collator
			
			iv.	DataBroker
			
			v. DataMapper
			
		b.	A composite solution can have a single isolated (i.e., an unconnected) model of type “MLModel”. 
		
		c.	An isolated model of any type other than of type “MLModel” is not allowed in a composite solution.
		
		d.	A composite solution cannot have more than one isolated (or unconnected) models, irrespective of their type.
		
		e.	A composite solution with a combination of connected and isolated models is not a valid solution.

		f.	Must retrieve the cdump file associated with the solution from Nexus repository.

		g.	Perform validation of the cdump file to make sure that no model (basic building blocks) is isolated / unconnected. 

		h.	If there are isolated models in the composite solution, then for each such model, the composition engine must create an error message such as “Error – Mode Name is not connected.”
		
		i.	An output port of a node can be connected to the input port of another node only if there exist matching message signatures on the pair of ports. (Rule checked by UI Layer)
		
		j.	An output port of a node of type “MLModel” can be connected to ONLY one input port of another node of type “MLModel” or “DataMapper” or “Splitter” or “Collator”,  [NOTE: Design Studio will NOT restrict the user, but during Validation this should be flagged as error.] 
		
		k.	An output port of a node of type “DataBroker” can be connected to ONLY one input port of another node of type “MLModel” or “DataMapper” or “Splitter” or “Collator”,  [NOTE: Design Studio will NOT restrict the user, but during Validation we will flag this error.]
		
		l.	An input port of a node of type “MLModel” can be connected to ONLY one output port of another node of any type. [NOTE: Design Studio will NOT restrict the user, but during Validation we will flag this error.]
		
		m.	A node of type “DataBroker” cannot have its input port connected to any other node. (to be modified later)
		
		n.	The Composition Engine must set success as False and send a list of error messages in the “validationMessages” list to the client.

		o.	If there are no errors, the Composition Engine must:

			i.	Create the Blueprint.json file (as described)

			ii.	Store the Blueprint.json in Nexus

			iii.	Store the location of Blueprint.json in Common Catalog DB.

			iv.	Set success as True and send “Successful” message in the “validationMessages” list to the client. 
			
			v.	Mark the validSolution flag in the cdump file as “true”.
			
			vi.	Store the cdump file in Nexus. 
			
	4.	If a Data Broker is included in the composite solution, then after the solution is successfully validated in the Design Studio, the Composition Engine must do the following functions:
		
		a.	Retrieve the Protobuf file of the ML Model connected to the Data Broker from Nexus and populate it in the protobufFile field of the data_broker_map. 
		
	5.	If a Data Mapper is included in the composite solution, then after the solution is successfully validated in the Design Studio, the Composition Engine must do the following functions:
	
		a.	Generate the Protobuf Wrapper for the Data Mapper – This Wrapper converts: 
			
			i.	From Java to Protobuf types for the outgoing message (on the output side of the Data Mapper).
			
			ii.	From Protobuf to Java types for the incoming message (on the input side of the Data Mapper)
			
		b.	Create the jar file of the Data Mapper with the field level mappings, as designed in the Design Studio. 
		
		c.	Convert the jar to Microservices. Note the Data Mapper exposes an operation called mapData and the input arguments to the operation are the same as those defined on the input side of the Data Mapper.
		
		d.	Create the Docker Image of the Data Mapper Microservice.
		
		e.	Store the Docker image of the Data Mapper in the Nexus repository.
		
		f.	Store the location of the docker image in the TGIF.json of the Data Mapper.
			
			
22. SetProbeIndicator
----------------------

	**Operation Name**

	setProbeIndicator
	
	**Trigger**

	This operation is called by the UI Layer when the user clicks or un clicks the Probe Indicator Button in the Design Studio, to indicate if he wants the Probe to be included or not in the composite solution. By clicking this button the user intends to set or unset a probe indicator in the backend.
	
	**Request**
	
	{
		
		userId: string, //mandatory
		
		solutionId: string // this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution
		
		vetrsion: string// this field will be empty for a new un – saved solution. It is mandatory for a saved solution
		
		cid: string // composition Id originally generated by backend and returned to UI Layer as a response to createNewCompositeSolution API, now it is provided as input by UI Layer –  this field should be populated (mandatory) if the solutionId and version is missing such as  for a new un – saved solution.
		
		probeIndicator: String //True or False //Mandatory. 
		
	}
	
	**Response**

	{

		success: boolean,

		errorMessage: string //error string to be displayed to DS User.

	}

	**Behavior**

	1.	The Composition Engine must check if the request JSON structure is valid, otherwise it should return success as false and a user friendly message, such as “Incorrectly formatted input – Invalid JSON”. 
	
	2.	The Composition Engine must ensure that all the fields marked mandatory are populated,  otherwise it must return success as “false” and populate the
	helpful error message which is displayed to the user, such as “Cannot perform requested operation – User Id missing”, etc.
	
	3.	The Composition Engine must:
		
		a.	Must set the probeIndicator to either “true” or “false” value in the cdump file as received in the request.



Including a Swagger File
========================
Acumos uses `Swagger <https://swagger.io/>`_ to generate dynamic API docs. However, to read the docs you must have access to the Swagger server running on your Acumos instance. This can be inconvenient, so the Docs project uses a Sphinx plugin called `sphinx-swaggerdoc <https://github.com/unaguil/sphinx-swaggerdoc/>`_, which provides an RST directive to render a ``swagger.json`` file. The sphinx-swaggerdoc extension is defined in the Documentation project's ``conf.py`` file.

You an include your API JSON file either by pointing to a URL or by pointing to a file. This example uses a local file called ``example-swagger.json``.  See the `sphinx-swaggerdoc <https://github.com/unaguil/sphinx-swaggerdoc/>`_ for more examples.
